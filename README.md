# AO3 EPUB TOOLS 
  
This toolset helps process and organize .epub files downloaded from Archive of Our Own (AO3). It includes functions to extract metadata, rename files, sort files by author or language, and merge multiple EPUBs into a single collection.

## Features  
1. **Extract Metadata to CSV**  

Parse a folder of AO3 .epub files and generate a .csv file containing metadata (e.g., title, author, tags, summary, etc.).  

2. **Rename EPUB Files (based on metadata)**  

Automatically rename all .epub files using standardized formats, updating the CSV after renaming.

3. **Sort and Copy/Move EPUBs**  

Organize .epub files into subfolders (by author or language), optionally copying or moving them. Also updates metadata and file names.

4. **Merge Multiple EPUBs into One**  

Merge several AO3 .epub files into a single EPUB file (e.g., a collection or themed bundle), preserving chapter order.

## How to Use
Run with .bat (Recommended)
You can launch the tool by running the provided run.bat file, which calls main() in main.py.
